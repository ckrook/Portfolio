            <p className="mt-6 text-gray-300">
              Hey! I'm Charles Krook, a junior Front-End Developer in Stockholm
              who is currently studying Front-end Development at Medieinstitutet
              and are looking to apply for an internship this fall - October
              2022.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6 text-gray-300">
              Ever since my late teens I have been interested in web
              technologies & design. Which has gradually led me down the path of
              Frontend Development.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6 text-gray-300">
              I have previously worked supporting e-commerce merchants and
              maintaining Klarna's internal infrastructure which has been an
              exciting time of personal and professional growth for me. However,
              since I started my studies in Front-End Development I feel excited
              for new adventures in my career.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6 text-gray-300">
              There is much to be said for experience and education, but most
              vital to succeeding at any job are someoneâ€™s personal qualities. I
              am naturally very ambitious and curious. I have the ability to
              easily cooperate with others. I would also describe myself as
              adaptable, quality-conscious and verbal.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6 text-gray-300">
              I hope that this brief presentation of who I am has been of
              interest to you. Lets talk more over a coffee!
